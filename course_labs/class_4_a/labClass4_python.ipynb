    "### I. Discover API Documentation\n",
    "First, let's take a look at the [API Docs](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/) for the free WeatherAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing discovery on an API, look for answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What endpoints are available and what data sources do they offer?\n",
    "2. How is Authentication performed when making requests?\n",
    "3. Is a software development kit (SDK) available?\n",
    "4. How are requests to the API formatted?\n",
    "5. How are request payloads formatted? What fields are included?\n",
    "\n",
    "The WeatherAPI offers forecasted and historical weather data as well as location, astronomy, and other misc endpoints. For this lab, we will be focusing on current and forecasted weather. But feel free to explore the other endpoints available. Data is returned in json or xml format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication is performed via API Key. We can get one by signing up for a free account. In general, it is not a best practice to include API Keys directly in the code that is making the API request. We will cover storing and retrieving API Keys in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SDKs](https://github.com/weatherapicom/) are available in several programming languages. SDKs are useful tools as they provide shortcuts and integrations for developing in the programming language of your choice. We will not be using the WeatherAPI SDK for this lab, but much of the code we will write for this lab has already been replicated in some form via the SDK. In general, use SDKs when they are available. They will save you time.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Requests are formatted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`base url + <endpoint_name>.<file_extension> + auth + <query>`\n",
    "\n",
    "With:\n",
    "\n",
    "base url = `'http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/'`\n",
    "\n",
    "auth = `'key=<api_key>'`\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at some examples in Part III.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's look at the docs for the forecast API. It looks like the payload contains three parts:\n",
    "1. A day element containing the date and daily forecast information\n",
    "2. An astro element sunrise and sunset data\n",
    "3. An hour element containing the datetime and hourly forecast information\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore these later on in the lab.\n"

It is commonly used for config files as it is extremely easy to write due to it's lack of punctuation,\n",

    "### III. Making API Calls in Python\n",
    "The Python [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) Library is a lightweight tool for making HTTP and API requests. It's also part of the Python standard library, making it easily accessible in all applications. Let's examine some of it's features by using the Current Weather endpoint from WeatherAPI.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The base url: `'http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/'`\n",
    "2. The Endpoint and return file format: `'current.json'`\n",
    "3. Our API Key: `'key=<weather_key>'`\n",
    "4. And our query, which will be the location for which we want the current weather\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example from the API Docs: `http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&q=London`\n",
    "Notice how the pieces are combined:\n",
    "1. There is a question mark (\"?\") between the endpoint and auth components\n",
    "2. The query component begins with \"q=\"\n",
    "3. And there is an ampersand (\"&\") between the auth and query components.\n",
