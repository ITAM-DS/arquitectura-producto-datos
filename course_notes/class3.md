- Emphasis on hardware, not the package

## Fundamentals of Information Technology
### How to build a (On Prem) computer network

#### Three components of computing
1. Storage
  - Data/file store
2. Compute
  - Hardware to process/transform data
2. Networking
  - Hardware and software to access data remotely

#### On Prem Set up
(Image of Server Room)
- Data lives on computer called servers in rooms like this
- Specialized hardware called switches run programs that control access to the servers
- Data is accessed via Intranet
  - Differs from internet in that only available on the local network
  - Can be wireless or over fiber
- Laptops or desktops are provisioned with access to the Intranet

#### What is the cloud?
- Intranet vs Internet
  - Internet accessible from any wired or wireless network
- Cloud computing is hardware accessible from the Internet
- Google drive (sheets) is cloud computing:
  - Storage (File store)
  - Compute (Functions & macros)
  - Networking (can share with other users)

#### Cloud Service Providers
- Who are they?
  - AWS
  - GCP
  - Azure
  - IBM
  - Oracle
  - Salesforce
- What do they do?
  - Virtually replicate on prem network
- How?
  - Data centers
    - Physically secure
    - Disaster free areas
  - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
    - Software that emulates an intranet
    
#### Why choose the cloud
- Cost
  - No upfront costs
  - Scales easily
  - Only pay for what you use
- Hardware
  - Cooling
  - Space
  - Electric
- Human capital
  - Building and maintaining on prem is hard (which makes people who can do so expensive)
- Flexibility
  - Spin up and tear down infra with ease
  - Software easily accessible
  - Specialty hardware easier to access

#### Why choose on prem?
- Security
  - Intranet *can* be safer
  - Physical Security
    - Some companies like being in possession of their data
- Customization
- Large data
  - Can be faster to move over fiber
